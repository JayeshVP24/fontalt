Font Alt is here to help you by providing a library of your favorite font alternatives. Currently, we have sans-serif, serif, slab serif, and handwritten typefaces.

Visit [fontalt.com](https://fontalt.com/) to get alternatives for your favorite fonts.

If your font is not on our website or you want to suggest some alternatives, [submit the font](https://tally.so/r/3lddgV), and we will list it for you!
